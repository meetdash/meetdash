### Hi, I'm Dashmeet Kaur 👩‍💻 👋

I am a system security enthusiast starting out in the fascinating world of cybersecurity. My undivided interest lies in improving the reliability of systems and networks in this constantly enmeshing web world.

YouTuber Jim Browning, who identifies and tracks down scammers on the internet stealing millions of dollars from vulnerable and unusually trusting people, has had a significant impact on me. His abundant knowledge and his ability to utilize it to serve the community was one of the major factors that pushed me into this field. I truly believe I can bring about momentous transformations in minimizing the primitive opportunity for attacks and help in improving the level of general awareness about computer security and privacy.

Post graduation, I plan to work in research centers, in academia or in the industry, to safeguard systems and educate young minds about this field.

I am currently, quite enthusiatically, exploring the ins and outs of Computer Security. I am learning lots of new tools, attending a variety of security conferences and workshops, exposing myself to a plethora of online resources, and interacting with some of the most brilliant minds in the field.

This is my happy place.
